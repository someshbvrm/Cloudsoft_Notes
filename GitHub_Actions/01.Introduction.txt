GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform built directly into GitHub. 
It allows you to automate various tasks within your software development workflow.

GitHub Actions: Components
--------------------------
Workflows

- A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
- Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository.
- Workflows are defined by a YAML file.

Jobs

- A job is a set of steps in a workflow that is executed on the same runner.
- Each step is either a shell script that will be executed, or an action that will be run.
- Steps are executed in order and are dependent on each other.

Events

- An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run.
- For example, activity can originate from GitHub when someone creates a pull request, opens an issue, or pushes a commit to a repository.

Actions

- An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task.
- Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files.

Runners

- A runner is a server that runs your workflows when theyâ€™re triggered. Each runner can run a single job at a time.
- GitHub provides GitHub runners, and we can also create self-hosted runners to run our workflows.

Workflow structure


name: My Awesome Workflow  # The name of your workflow

on:
  push:  # This workflow will trigger on a push event

jobs:
  build:  # The name of your job within the workflow
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # This job will run on an Ubuntu runner
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3  # Checkout the code from the repository
      
      # Add additional steps here to perform actions within your workflow
      - run: echo "Hello, world! This is a simple GitHub Actions workflow."  # Example step to print a message
