# Using Variables in GitHub Actions

Variables for Single Workflow
Define variables using the `env` key in the workflow file. The scope of a custom variable is limited to the element where it is defined. Variables can be scoped for:

- The entire workflow (using `env` at the top level)
- A specific job within a workflow
- A particular step within a job

Configuration Variables for Multiple Workflows

You can create configuration variables for use across multiple workflows, and can define them at either the organization, repository, or environment level.


Context Variables from GitHub Metadata

Contexts provide access to information about workflow runs, variables, runner environments, jobs, and steps.  
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts#github-context  


Input for Manually Triggered Workflows

When using the workflow_dispatch event, you can optionally specify inputs that are passed to the workflow.

**GitHub Actions Runners**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Runner: Server that executes workflows.

  Two Types:
1. GitHub-Hosted
   - Managed by GitHub
   - Pre-configured VMs
   - Auto maintenance
   - Free minutes with limits

2. Self-Hosted
   - Your own server
   - You maintain
   - Fully customizable
   - Free usage (you pay for hardware)

Function: Runners pick up jobs and execute workflow steps.

**GitHub Actions Usage Limits**

GitHub-Hosted Runners
- Job execution time: 6 hours max per job
- Workflow run time: 35 days max per workflow
- API requests: 1,000 requests/hour per repository
- Concurrent jobs: Varies by plan (see table below)

Standard GitHub-Hosted Runners - Concurrent Jobs
| GitHub Plan   | Total Jobs | Max macOS Jobs |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Free          | 20         | 5              |
| Pro           | 40         | 5              |
| Team          | 60         | 5              |
| Enterprise    | 500        | 50             |

Self-Hosted Runners
- Job execution time: 5 days max per job
- Workflow run time: 35 days max per workflow
- Job queue time: 24-48 hours max queue time
- API requests: 1,000 requests/hour per repository
- Job matrix: Max 256 jobs per workflow run
- Workflow run queue: Max 500 runs/10 seconds per repo
- Runner registration: Max 10,000 runner groups

Notes:
- Exceeding time limits causes job/workflow termination
- Exceeding API limits causes failed API calls and potential job failures
- Additional jobs beyond concurrency limits are queued
- Self-hosted runners have longer execution limits but require manual management
