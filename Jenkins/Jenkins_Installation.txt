Jenkins URL 
http://localhost:8080

Browse to http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port you configured for Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the Unlock Jenkins page appears.

From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically-generated alphanumeric password.

The command: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword will print the password at console.

If Jenkins fails to start because a port is in use, run systemctl edit jenkins and add the following:
