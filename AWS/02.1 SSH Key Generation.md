# SSH Key Generation Guide

## Generate a New SSH Key Pair

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Command Options:

| Option | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `-t`   | Key type (rsa, ed25519, ecdsa)       |
| `-b`   | Key length (4096 bits recommended)   |
| `-C`   | Comment (usually your email)         |

## Key Files Created

```
~/.ssh/
├── id_rsa      # Private key (keep secure!)
└── id_rsa.pub  # Public key (share this)
```

## How to Use

### 1. Copy Public Key

```bash
# Linux/macOS
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy      # macOS
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | xclip -sel clip  # Linux

# Windows
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | clip
```

### 2. Add to GitHub

1. Go to **Settings** → **SSH and GPG Keys**
2. Click **New SSH Key**
3. Paste your public key
4. Click **Add SSH Key**

### 3. Connect to Remote Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote-host
```

## Security Best Practices

- 🔐 Always use a passphrase
- 🔒 Set proper permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
  ```
- 🚫 Never share private keys
- 🔄 Consider rotating keys annually

## Troubleshooting

**Permission denied (publickey)?**

1. Verify key was added to remote server:
   ```bash
   ssh -v user@remote-host
   ```
2. Check server's SSH config:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   Ensure these lines exist:
   ```
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

> **Pro Tip**: For modern systems, Ed25519 is recommended:
> ```bash
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
> ```
