# Step-by-Step Guide: Creating an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS

## Prerequisites
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- At least two EC2 instances running in different Availability Zones
- Security groups configured to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic

## Step 1: Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console
2. Search for "EC2" in the services search bar or navigate to "Services" > "Compute" > "EC2"

## Step 2: Start the Load Balancer Creation Process
1. In the EC2 dashboard, look at the left sidebar
2. Under "Load Balancing", click "Load Balancers"
3. Click the "Create Load Balancer" button

## Step 3: Select Load Balancer Type
1. Choose "Application Load Balancer" (the first option)
2. Click "Create"

## Step 4: Configure Basic Settings
1. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "my-web-app-alb")
2. **Scheme**: 
   - Choose "internet-facing" for public access
   - Choose "internal" for private VPC-only access
3. **IP address type**: 
   - Choose "IPv4" (most common) 
   - Or "dualstack" if you need IPv6

## Step 5: Network Mapping
1. **VPC**: Select your Virtual Private Cloud
2. **Mappings**: 
   - Select at least two Availability Zones
   - For each zone, select a public subnet
   - (ALB requires subnets in at least 2 AZs)

## Step 6: Security Groups
1. Select an existing security group or create new
2. Ensure it allows:
   - Inbound HTTP (port 80) and/or HTTPS (port 443)
   - Outbound to your instances (usually port 80/443 or your app port)

## Step 7: Configure Listeners and Routing
1. **Listener**: 
   - Default is HTTP on port 80
   - Click "Add listener" for HTTPS on 443 if needed
2. **Default action**:
   - Select "Forward to..."
   - Click "Create target group"

### Creating Target Group (if needed)
1. **Target type**: "Instances" (most common)
2. **Name**: Enter a name (e.g., "web-servers-tg")
3. **Protocol**: HTTP (or your application protocol)
4. **Port**: 80 (or your application port)
5. **VPC**: Same as your load balancer
6. **Health checks**:
   - Path: "/" or your health check endpoint
   - Protocol: HTTP
   - Port: traffic port or override
   - Advanced: Adjust thresholds as needed
7. Click "Next" to register targets

## Step 8: Register Targets
1. Select your EC2 instances from the list
2. Click "Include as pending below"
3. Review and click "Create target group"

## Step 9: Complete ALB Configuration
1. Back on the ALB page, select your new target group
2. Review all settings
3. Click "Create load balancer"

## Step 10: Verify and Test
1. Wait for the ALB status to change from "provisioning" to "active"
2. Note the DNS name (e.g., "my-web-app-alb-1234567890.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com")
3. Test by accessing the DNS name in a browser or with curl:
   ```
   curl http://your-alb-dns-name
   ```

## Post-Creation Configuration (Optional)
- Set up HTTPS:
  1. Add HTTPS listener (port 443)
  2. Attach SSL certificate from ACM
- Configure path-based routing
- Set up redirects from HTTP to HTTPS
- Configure access logs
- Set up WAF protection
