# **Public Subnet vs Private Subnet in AWS**

## **Overview**
In AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), subnets are segmented into **public** and **private** based on their internet accessibility and routing behavior.

---

## **1. Public Subnet**
- **Definition**: A subnet that can directly communicate with the internet.
- **Key Features**:
  - Has a **route to an Internet Gateway (IGW)** in its route table.
  - Instances in a public subnet can have **public IPs or Elastic IPs (EIPs)**.
  - Typically used for:
    - Load Balancers (ALB, NLB)
    - Bastion hosts (jump servers for SSH access)
    - NAT Gateways (for outbound internet access from private subnets)
    - Web servers facing the internet

### **Example Route Table for Public Subnet**
| Destination      | Target          |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `10.0.0.0/16`    | Local (VPC)     |
| `0.0.0.0/0`      | `igw-12345` (Internet Gateway) |

### **Security Considerations**
- Must use **Security Groups (SGs)** and **NACLs** to restrict unwanted traffic.
- Should avoid placing databases or backend services here.

---

## **2. Private Subnet**
- **Definition**: A subnet that **cannot** directly access the internet.
- **Key Features**:
  - **No direct route to an Internet Gateway**.
  - Instances typically use **only private IPs** (no public IP assignment).
  - Can access the internet via:
    - **NAT Gateway** (placed in a public subnet)
    - **NAT Instance** (less common, legacy)
  - Used for:
    - Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
    - Application servers (backend services)
    - Internal microservices

### **Example Route Table for Private Subnet**
| Destination      | Target          |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `10.0.0.0/16`    | Local (VPC)     |
| `0.0.0.0/0`      | `nat-12345` (NAT Gateway) |

### **Security Considerations**
- More secure since no direct internet exposure.
- Still needs **SGs & NACLs** for internal VPC traffic control.
- Can use **VPC Endpoints** (e.g., for S3, DynamoDB) to avoid NAT costs.

## **Key Differences**
| Feature              | Public Subnet                     | Private Subnet                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Internet Access**  | Direct (via IGW)                  | Indirect (via NAT Gateway/Instance) |
| **Public IPs**       | Yes (auto-assigned or Elastic IP) | No (only private IPs)              |
| **Typical Use Cases**| Web servers, Load Balancers       | Databases, Backend services        |
| **Route Table**      | Routes to `0.0.0.0/0` via IGW     | Routes to `0.0.0.0/0` via NAT      |
| **Security Risk**    | Higher (exposed to internet)      | Lower (no direct internet access)  |

---

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use Private Subnets** for databases & backend services to minimize exposure.
2. **Place NAT Gateways in Public Subnets** to allow private instances internet access.
3. **Avoid assigning public IPs** to instances in private subnets.
4. **Use Bastion Hosts** (in a public subnet) for SSH access to private instances.
5. **Monitor & Restrict Traffic** using SGs and NACLs in both subnets.

### **Summary**
- **Public Subnet** → Direct internet access (IGW), used for public-facing services.
- **Private Subnet** → No direct internet access, uses NAT for outbound traffic, more secure.  
Both are essential for building secure, scalable AWS architectures.
