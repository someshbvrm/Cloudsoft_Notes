Docker Networking:

Types of network drivers.

	1. Bridge - container accessible to all
	2. Host - container accessible from host only
	3. Overlay - in swarm container accessible from one host to another host
	4. ipvlan - ipv4 and ipv6 can be assigned to container
	5. Macvlan - for every container macid is attached
	6. None - container cannot be accessed.

By default bridge network is created for a container.


docker network create my-net	#Creating bridge network

docker network inspect my-net	#Ispecting the network

docker network ls	#Listing all networks

docker network rm my-net	#Removing the network

Creating container and network
docker create --name my-nginx --network my-net --publish 8080:8080 nginx:latest

Attaching network to existing container
docker network connect my-net my-nginx	#To attach network

docker network disconnect my-net my-nginx	#To detach network

If we have two containers, by default they wont communicate with eachother. We need to attach them to same network to communicate.

Ex: Tomcat - MySQL

Old method - Attaching the containers to same network
New method - Using overlay

docker run --rm -d --network host --name my_nginx nginx		#-d means to start the container detached (in the background)
								#rm option means to remove the container once it stops/exits
